# Example with a long text (Fisher, 1935: 6)
text1 <- "The discrepancy of opinion among historical writers on probability is so great that to mention the subject is unavoidable. It would, however, be out of place here to argue the point in detail. I will only state three considerations which will explain why, in the practical applications of the subject, I shall not assume the truth of Bayesâ€™ axiom. Two of these reasons would, I think, be generally admitted, but the first, I can well imagine, might be indignantly repudiated in some quarters."
bow(text1)

# Example with multiple documents
text2 <- c("Bayes is from England", "Bayes is a statistician", "Bayes formulated Bayes Theorem")
bow(text2)
